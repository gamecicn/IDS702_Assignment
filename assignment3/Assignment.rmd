## Summary

In this investigation, a logistic regression model was built to quest the relationship between smoking and pre-term birth. Other factors would also be analyzed to check whether they could contribute to pre-term birth or change the relationship between smoking and premature delivery.

\hfill\break

## Introduction

This analysis based on a dataset from a study carried between 1960 and 1967 at the Kaiser Foundation Hospital in Oakland, CA. `r nrow(df)` observations were included in the analysis. Logistic regression was exploited as the primary technique to quest the answer to the following questions. 

- Is there any relationship between pre-term birth and mother's smoking? If any, how much the difference of odds ratio of pre-term birth between smoking and nonsmoking mother. 

- Would the mother's race have a significant influence on the correlation?

- Apart from smoking, are there any other factors in the data that would contribute to pre-term birth.

- For the above four factors, their behavior on facilitating pre-term birth seems different with smoking and nonsmoking. Further investigation would be implemented in the modeling step. 


```{r echo = FALSE, include=FALSE}
# Hide 

# Explore Premature & factor variables

chisq.test(table(df[,c("Premature_fac","mrace")]))


apply(table(df[,c("Premature_fac","smoke")])/sum(table(df[,c("Premature_fac","smoke")])),  2,function(x) x/sum(x)) 

tapply(df$Premature_fac, df$smoke, function(x) table(x)/sum(table(x)))
chisq.test(table(df[,c("Premature_fac","smoke")]))

chisq.test(table(df[,c("Premature_fac","med")]))

df$inc_fac <- as.factor(df$inc)
chisq.test(table(df[,c("Premature_fac","inc_fac")]))

```


###  Race  

Mother's race and education status have strong association with premature. 

```{r echo = FALSE, results='asis'}

xtable(apply(table(df[,c("Premature_fac","med")])/sum(table(df[,c("Premature_fac","med")])), 2,function(x) x/sum(x)) )

chi <- chisq.test(table(df[,c("Premature_fac","med")]))
```

- The chisq-test's p-value of mother's education vs prematrue is `r round(chi$p.value, 4)`, which mean there is a strong tie between mother's educational experience and premature rate 

- There is some noticeable difference in the premature rate between mothers with diverse educational backgrounds.  Mothers with college or some college experience are more likely premature than others. 

### Education

```{r echo = FALSE, results='asis'}

xtable(apply(table(df[,c("Premature_fac","mrace")])/sum(table(df[,c("Premature_fac","mrace")])), 2,function(x) x/sum(x)) )

chi <- chisq.test(table(df[,c("Premature_fac","mrace")]))
```

- The chisq-test's p-value of mother's ramce vs prematrue is `r round(chi$p.value, 4)`, which mean there is a strong associaton between mother's race and premature rate.  

- Comparing with other rame, mix race has a much higher probability of having pre-term birth. 

- Asian mother's premature rate is remarkably lower than mothers of other races. 


###  Smoking

```{r echo = FALSE, results='asis'}

xtable(apply(table(df[,c("Premature_fac","smoke")])/sum(table(df[,c("Premature_fac","smoke")])), 2,function(x) x/sum(x)) )

chi <- chisq.test(table(df[,c("Premature_fac","smoke")]))

```

- The chisq-test's p-value of mother's smoking vs. premature is `r round(chi$p.value, 4)`, which mean the association is extremely weak or even not exist

- This is a somewhat unexpected finding; typically, the common sense is that smoking would bring various disadvantages to health. To be confirmed, the result would be investigated in the following steps. 

## Model


```{r echo = FALSE , include=FALSE}

pre_modle1 <- glm(Premature_fac ~ parityCent + mageCent + mhtCent + mpregwtCent + smoke + inc + mrace + med +  mhtCent:smoke , data = df, family = binomial)

summary(pre_modle1)

res1 <- residuals(pre_modle1,"resp")

binnedplot(x=fitted(pre_modle1),y=res1,xlab="Pred. probabilities",
           col.int="red4",ylab="Avg. residuals",main="Binned residual plot",col.pts="navy")

binnedplot(x=df$parityCent,y=res1,xlab="Arsenic centered",
           col.int="red4",ylab="Avg. residuals",main="Binned residual plot",col.pts="navy")

binnedplot(x=df$mageCent,y=res1,xlab="Arsenic centered",
           col.int="red4",ylab="Avg. residuals",main="Binned residual plot",col.pts="navy")


binnedplot(x=df$mhtCent,y=res1,xlab="Arsenic centered",
           col.int="red4",ylab="Avg. residuals",main="Binned residual plot",col.pts="navy")

binnedplot(x=df$mpregwtCent,y=res1,xlab="Arsenic centered",
           col.int="red4",ylab="Avg. residuals",main="Binned residual plot",col.pts="navy")

```
